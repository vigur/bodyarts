markup:
  goldmark:
    parser:
      attribute:
        block: true
    renderer:
      unsafe: true
```

### Customize main color

In your config file, add:

```yaml
params:
  mainColor: "#386641"
```

This will override the main.scss

```css
/*
=======================================================
=                   CSS Variables                     =
=======================================================
*/

/* 
Main color for the website
It can be overridden in the config file by setting "Params.mainColor" to any color value
*/
:root {
  --main-color: #035c8c; /* default color */
}
```

### Set Google Maps url

In your config file, add:

```yaml
params:
  gmaps_url: https://tinyurl.com/mr3uesbx
```

### Image Gallery

#### Use as partial
In your `.md` file, specify the type of the page with `type: gallery-masonry` or  `type: gallery-insta` like this:

```yaml
---
title: Air is a great hugo theme
type: gallery-masonry
---
Air is a great hugo theme with outstanding features like image gallery from page bundle
```

#### Use as shortcode

Assuming your folder structure would look something like this

```yaml
content/
└── pages/
    └── my-page/                # Page Bundle
        ├── index.md            # Page content
        ├── featured-image.jpg  # Image Resource used as gallery image 1
        ├── card.jpg            # Image Resource used as gallery image 2 AND as card featured image
        ├── photo1.jpg          # Image Resource used as gallery image 3
        ├── photo2.jpg          # Image Resource used as gallery image 4
        └── photo3.jpg          # Image Resource used as gallery image 5
```

In your `.md` file, add this block to display your instagram image gallery

`{{` `< gallery-masonry page="my-page" >` `}}` 


where "my-page" is the page bundle object passed as a variable to the shortcode

Alternatively, use instagram gallery style with

`{{` `< gallery-insta page="my-page" >` `}}`

### Custom Header image

Add one image called `featured-image.jpg` in your page bundle.

#### Use as a featured header image in `single.html`
Automatically loaded as a header image on your page

##### Use the default featured header image
Automatically loaded from the `static/img` folder.
- `header-960.jpg` for screens higher than 960px
- `header-480.jpg` for screens lower than 960px

### Custom Boostrap Card image

#### Use as featured card image in `list.html`
When listing pages/posts, it displays boostrap cards with a thumbnail image.  
By default it uses the card image from  `static/img/card.jpg`
Customize the card image by adding one image called `featured-image.jpg` or `card.jpg ` in your page bundle.  

### Single-page landing homepage

Add pages to a folder. These page will render as a single-page.

Example with this page bundle:

```yaml
content/
└── landing-page/
    └── page-1/                 # Page Bundle
        ├── featured-image.jpg  # 
        ├── index.md            # Page 1
    ├── _index.md               # File that calls the landing-page type
    ├── page-2.md               # Page 2
    ├── page-3.md               # Page 3
    ├── page-4.md               # Page 4
    └── page-5.md               # Page 5
```

Edit your  `content/landing-page/_index.md` to add `type: landing-page`

```yaml 
---
title: Landing Page
catchline: Awesome One Page Landing Page
type: landing-page
---
```

Add a weight to each page to render them by weight ✨: 

```yaml
---
title: Page 1
weight: 10
---
Content of Page 1
```
